 ##Project Requirement List

For my Task List Organizer project I implemented several key features to ensure the program worked as intended.  Below is a summary of the requirements I followed
:

1) CRUD Operations:
I implemented functionality to Create,Read,Update and Delete tasks.This feature was essential for task management,allowing users to add,modify view and remove tasks as needed

2) Command-Line Interface (CLI):
I designed the program to use a CLI for interacting with users.The CLI presented clear menus and options making it easy for users to manage their tasks

3) Data Persistence:
To ensure that tasks were saved even after closing the program I stored tasks in a file (either .txt,.csv,  .json). This kept users data available between sessions

4)Input Validation:
I validated user input to ensure all task details were entered correctly,preventing empty task names or invalid dates.This helped avoid errors and ensured smooth functionality

5)Error Handling:
I implemented error handling to manage situations like invalid task IDs,incorrect menu choices or file errors.This helped guide users when they made mistakes

6)Task Reporting:
I included the ability to generate reports showing the total number of tasks along with how many were completed and how many were still pending.This provided users with a clear overview of their task progress

7)Task Export/Import:
I added functionality to import and export tasks in formats like CSV or JSON.this was useful for sharing and backing up task data

8)Data Structure for tasks:
I selected appropriate data structures (such as arrays or lists) to store task data efficiently ensuring fast access and easy manipulation

Documentation:
I provided clear documentation throughout the code explaining the purpose of each function and module.This made it easier for others to understand and maintain the code in the future
