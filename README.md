My project is the Task List Organizer is a simple program that helps users manage their daily tasks.It allows users to add,view, update and delete tasks using a command-line interface. This program is designed to be used through a CLI making it lightweight and easy to operate.One of the key features of this application is data persistence tasks are stored in a file,so users can access their tasks even after closing and reopening the program.The application also ensures input validation,preventing incorrect or empty entries and includes error handling to guide users in case of invalid inputs.Also the program can generate summary reports that provide insights into task statuses such as completed and pending tasks
For flexibility,the program also supports importing and exporting task data in different file formats making it easier to share orback up information
