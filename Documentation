#ALGORITHMS AND LOGIC:

1) CRUD Operations:

Create:Adds  new task to the list and saves it to the file
Read: Displays tasks from the saved file
Update:Modifies  existing task based on its ID
Delete: Removes a task from the list and file

2) Input Validation:

Validates user input for task details (f.e  non-empty task names,correct date formats)

3) Error Handling:

Catches issues like invalid input or missing files displaying helpful error messages

4) Task Export asnd Import:

Tasks are exported to and imported from CSV/JSON files to persist data


##DATA STRUCTURES:

ArrayList:Stores tasks with properties like ID,Name and Due Date

String:Used for task details and user input

File: Tasks are saved to a file for persistence between sessions


###FUNCTIONS AND MODULES:

1) Task Management:Functions like addTask(),updateTask() and deleteTask() handle task operations

2) File Handling:Functions like readFromFile()and saveToFile() manage file input or output

3)Input Validation:Functions like isValidTaskName() ensure correct data entry

4)Reporting: Generates summaries of tasks ( like completed, pending)


####CHALLENGES:

1) Error Handling:Preventing crashes from invalid inputs

2) Input Validation: Handling correct formats for task details
